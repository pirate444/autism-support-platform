# Notification System

## Overview

The Autism Support Platform now includes a comprehensive notification system that keeps users informed about important events and activities across the platform.

## Features

### Notification Types

The system supports the following notification types:

1. **Collaboration Requests**
   - `collaboration_request_approved` - When a collaboration request is approved
   - `collaboration_request_rejected` - When a collaboration request is rejected
   - `collaboration_request_received` - New collaboration request received (admin only)

2. **Student Activities**
   - `note_added` - When a note is added to an assigned student
   - `appointment_added` - When an appointment is scheduled for an assigned student
   - `progress_report_added` - When a progress report is added for an assigned student
   - `student_assigned` - When a student is assigned to a user
   - `student_unassigned` - When a student is unassigned from a user

3. **Course Activities**
   - `course_created` - When a new course is created
   - `course_published` - When a course is published

4. **System Notifications**
   - `message_received` - When a new message is received
   - `system_announcement` - System-wide announcements

### Backend Implementation

#### Models
- **Notification Model** (`backend/src/models/Notification.js`)
  - Stores notification data with relationships to students, users, courses, etc.
  - Includes read status and timestamps
  - Indexed for efficient queries

#### Services
- **Notification Service** (`backend/src/services/notificationService.js`)
  - Handles creation of different notification types
  - Manages notification logic for various platform events
  - Supports bulk notifications for system announcements

#### Controllers
- **Notification Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/notificationController.js`)
  - `getMyNotifications` - Get user's notifications with pagination
  - `markAsRead` - Mark individual notification as read
  - `markAllAsRead` - Mark all notifications as read
  - `deleteNotification` - Delete a notification
  - `getUnreadCount` - Get count of unread notifications
  - `getAllNotifications` - Admin endpoint to view all notifications

#### Routes
- **Notification Routes** (`backend/src/routes/notification.js`)
  - All routes require authentication
  - Supports pagination and filtering
  - Admin-only routes for system monitoring

### Frontend Implementation

#### Notifications Page
- **Location**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - View all notifications with pagination
  - Filter by unread status
  - Mark individual notifications as read
  - Mark all notifications as read
  - Delete notifications
  - Real-time unread count updates
  - Color-coded notification types
  - Time-ago formatting

#### Dashboard Integration
- **Notifications Card**: Added to dashboard with unread count badge
- **Real-time Updates**: Unread count updates automatically
- **Easy Access**: Direct link to notifications page

### API Endpoints

#### User Endpoints
- `GET /api/notifications/my` - Get user's notifications
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
- `PUT /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark notification as read
- `PUT /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification

#### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/notifications/all` - Get all notifications (admin only)

### Integration Points

#### Collaboration System
- **Request Creation**: Notifies admin of new collaboration requests
- **Request Approval**: Notifies requester of approval/rejection
- **Admin Response**: Includes admin feedback in rejection notifications

#### Student Management
- **Assignment Changes**: Notifies users when students are assigned/unassigned
- **Collaboration Activities**: Notifies assigned users of new notes, appointments, and reports

#### Course System
- **Course Creation**: Notifies all users of new courses
- **Course Publication**: Notifies users when courses are published

### User Experience

#### Notification Display
- **Icons**: Each notification type has a unique emoji icon
- **Colors**: Color-coded backgrounds for different notification types
- **Status**: Clear indication of read/unread status
- **Context**: Related information displayed (student names, user names, etc.)

#### Management Features
- **Bulk Actions**: Mark all notifications as read
- **Individual Actions**: Mark read or delete individual notifications
- **Filtering**: Show only unread notifications
- **Pagination**: Handle large numbers of notifications efficiently

#### Real-time Updates
- **Automatic Refresh**: Notifications update when new events occur
- **Count Badges**: Dashboard shows unread notification count
- **Immediate Feedback**: Actions provide immediate visual feedback

### Security Features

#### Access Control
- **User Isolation**: Users can only see their own notifications
- **Admin Oversight**: Admins can view all notifications for monitoring
- **Authentication Required**: All notification endpoints require valid authentication

#### Data Protection
- **Related Data**: Notifications include references to related entities
- **Audit Trail**: All notification activities are logged
- **Safe Deletion**: Users can only delete their own notifications

### Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- **Indexing**: Efficient queries with proper database indexes
- **Pagination**: Large result sets handled with pagination
- **Selective Loading**: Only necessary data loaded for each request

#### Frontend Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Notifications loaded on demand
- **Caching**: Unread counts cached and updated efficiently
- **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive API calls

### Future Enhancements

#### Planned Features
1. **Email Notifications**: Send email alerts for important notifications
2. **Push Notifications**: Browser push notifications for real-time alerts
3. **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable notification settings
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by date, type, and other criteria
5. **Notification Templates**: Customizable notification messages

#### Technical Improvements
1. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time notification delivery
2. **Notification Queues**: Handle high-volume notification scenarios
3. **Analytics**: Track notification engagement and effectiveness
4. **Mobile Support**: Optimize for mobile device notifications

### Usage Examples

#### For Users
1. **Check Notifications**: Visit `/dashboard/notifications` to view all notifications
2. **Stay Updated**: Receive automatic notifications for student activities
3. **Manage Requests**: Get notified when collaboration requests are approved/rejected
4. **Track Changes**: Monitor student assignments and course updates

#### For Admins
1. **Monitor Activity**: View all platform notifications for oversight
2. **Manage Requests**: Receive notifications for new collaboration requests
3. **System Monitoring**: Track user engagement and platform activity
4. **Announcements**: Send system-wide announcements to all users

### Testing Scenarios

#### Notification Creation
1. Submit collaboration request → Admin receives notification
2. Approve collaboration request → Requester receives notification
3. Add note to student → All assigned users receive notification
4. Create new course → All users receive notification

#### Notification Management
1. Mark notification as read → Unread count decreases
2. Mark all as read → All notifications marked as read
3. Delete notification → Notification removed from list
4. Filter unread → Only unread notifications displayed

#### Integration Testing
1. Dashboard badge updates → Unread count reflects correctly
2. Real-time updates → Notifications appear without page refresh
3. Pagination works → Large notification lists handled properly
4. Admin access → Admin can view all notifications

## Conclusion

The notification system provides a comprehensive solution for keeping users informed about platform activities. It enhances user engagement, improves communication, and ensures users never miss important updates about their students, courses, or collaboration requests.

The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, with clear separation between user and admin functionality. Future enhancements will further improve the user experience and provide additional communication channels.
